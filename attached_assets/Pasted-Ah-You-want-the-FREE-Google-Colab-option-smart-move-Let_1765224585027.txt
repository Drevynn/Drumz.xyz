## 💡 **Why This Product Could Work**

**The Problem You Solve:**  
Musicians (like you!) need backing drums to practice/record with. Current options suck:
- ❌ Hire a drummer: $100/hr
- ❌ Program drum machines: Takes forever
- ❌ Use loop packs: Generic, not custom

**Your Solution:**  
"140 BPM punk with crash fills" → Get custom WAV in 30 seconds

**Market Gap:**  
- Suno/Udio make full songs (not what musicians want)
- Nobody is doing JUST drums with AI
- You'd own this niche

**Target Users:**
- Solo guitarists/bassists (like you)
- Bedroom producers
- YouTube cover artists

**Pricing:**
- Free: 3/day
- Premium: $9.99/mo unlimited
- Pro: $29.99/mo (MIDI export, stems)

## ⚡ **TL;DR**

1. Download the Colab notebook
2. Upload to Google Colab
3. Run it (15 minutes, $0)
4. Listen to the drums
5. If good → We build the product

You already know how to deploy (from Pro Video Services). This could be a **week-long build** and a **solid side revenue stream**.
